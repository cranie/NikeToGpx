Converts your Nike+ GPS data to gpx. Importable for strava!
Uses a threshold for the so-called pauze-problem. This threshold too maximum 37,8 km/h. So beware if you're a pro runner(sprinter?), or when you used the watch for cycling. 

Run the script from a terminal or shell with : 

> php NikeToGpx username password

After this, imported runs are in the "import" folder.

Probably PHP 5 required!
